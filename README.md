Hazardous Asteroid Classification

This project explores the classification of hazardous asteroids using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used is from NASA's Near-Earth Object Program.

Data Visualization

The dataset was visualized to gain insights into the distribution of asteroid characteristics, such as diameter, velocity, and orbital parameters.

Machine Learning Models

The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated on the dataset:

1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. Naive Bayes
4. AdaBoost
5. Decision Tree

Model Evaluation

The performance of each model was evaluated using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices. The results are presented to facilitate model selection and comparison.

Key Findings

- DecisionTreeClassifier and AdaBoostClassifier achieved the highest accuracy of 99.4667%

Code Organization

The code is organized into the following sections:

- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Model training and evaluation
- Result visualization

Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Running the Code

To run the code, simply execute the Python script. The dataset is assumed to be in the same directory as the script. Modify the file path as needed.
